# TF Init

Used to setup basic templates for various project types.

Currently only `html` is supported.

## Install

	sudo npm install tfinit -g

## Usage

Run the following in the directory you are planning to start working on your webpage.

	tfinit html

Basic `index.html`, `index.js` and `style.css` files will be created that contain only the stuff we personally use 95% of the time.
